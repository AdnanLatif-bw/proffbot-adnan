These initiatives were executed by the team reporting to Adnan, with some projects involving his direct technical contribution, while most were led and developed independently by his team under his strategic guidance.\nHis team has executed high-impact initiatives including:\n\nProject 1: Operationalizing Large AI Models for Seismic Interpretation (Confidential, Supper Major)\nProject Delivered by Adnan\u2019s team\n\nPain Point\nDeep learning models developed for seismic-based hydrocarbon detection showed strong performance in R&D settings but were difficult to scale for production use. Challenges included model size, manual execution in technical environments (e.g., Jupyter), reliance on on-prem HPC, and lack of integration with interpretation workflows and data sources.\n\nAI-Driven Solution\nThe team Adnan led implemented a production-ready, end-to-end solution to deploy these large AI models in a scalable, cloud-native environment. The system enabled interpreters to interact with AI predictions in real-world workflows\u2014without requiring programming expertise or dedicated HPC access.\nIntegrated multi-volume seismic inputs for hydrocarbon anomaly detection\nMigrated model execution from manual notebooks to a robust backend system\nEnabled seamless access via cloud and integration with interpretation tools\n\n\nProject 2: AI-Powered DHI Detection (Confidential, Supper Major)\nProject Delivered by Adnan\u2019s team, technically lead by Adnan\n\nPain Point\nDirect Hydrocarbon Indicators (DHIs) are critical in reducing exploration risk, but manual interpretation is inconsistent and often fails to detect weak or non-standard DHI expressions\u2014especially when working across multiple seismic stacks and uncertain geological conditions.\n\nAI-Driven Solution\nThe team Adnan led implemented a deep learning\u2013based detection system that combined seismic stack data and well logs to identify DHI signatures with greater consistency. The solution used multi-task model architecture and transfer learning to boost generalization across diverse settings, and it incorporated both supervised and semi-supervised learning to handle sparse and noisy labels.\n Combining multiple seismic volumes with well data\n Applied a multi-task deep learning model to simultaneously predict multiple DHI indicators\n Used transfer architectures to initialize model weights from pre-trained networks\n Employed supervised learning with trusted interpreter labels and semi-supervised learning where ground truth was sparse\n Built ensemble outputs to improve confidence and reduce false positives\n\nProject 3: Predicting Geological Features Below Seismic Tuning Using Machine Learning (Major IOC)\nProject Delivered by Adnan\u2019s team, technically lead by Adnan\n\nPain Point\nGeological features such as thin sand bodies often fall below the vertical resolution of seismic data, where tuning effects mask the true geology. Traditional interpretation techniques struggle to recover meaningful signals once seismic tuning dominates, limiting the ability to map stratigraphic features accurately in early-stage exploration.\n\nML-Driven Solution\nThe team Adnan led implemented a machine learning solution to predict geological features\u2014particularly thin sands\u2014below the seismic tuning threshold.

  "key_areas_and_projects_delivered_by_the_team_led_by_adnan_at_sirius": "Adnan co-led one of Norway\u2019s largest industrial research consortia, SIRIUS, where his team focused on advancing scalable data access, AI innovation, and semantic technologies across energy, environmental, and healthcare domains. Key projects  include:\n\nProject 1: Geological Assistant / GeMS Project\nRole: Portfolio Leader, SIRIUS \u2013 Centre for Scalable Data Access\n\nChallenge:\nExploration geologists traditionally relied on intuitive, manual methods \u2014 often pen-and-paper sketches \u2014 to evaluate prospects based on sparse, uncertain data. This limited their ability to model and compare multiple subsurface scenarios systematically. Most decisions were based on a narrow set of seismic interpretations, often overemphasizing direct hydrocarbon indicators (DHIs) without integrating broader geological context. This led to misjudgments in several high-cost drilling projects.\n\nSolution:\nLed the development of GeMS (Geological Multi-Scenario Reasoner), a first-of-its-kind system that brought structured AI reasoning to geological interpretation. We combined data-driven seismic analysis with formal logic\u2013based scenario modeling, using techniques from software verification to represent geological rules, spatial-temporal relationships, and interpretive uncertainty. This allowed geoscientists to explore a digital, auditable space of plausible subsurface models \u2014 moving beyond single \"best guess\" interpretations.\n\nOutcome:\nGeMS redefined digital geology workflows by introducing a logic-based framework for modeling ambiguity and scenario reasoning. It empowered interpreters to evaluate exploration decisions more systematically, improving transparency and decision quality. This project demonstrated how AI, formal methods, and domain expertise can converge to address complex, high-stakes challenges in exploration.\nLeadership Highlights:\n Directed a multi-partner collaboration across academia (UiO, NTNU), industry (Equinor, Schlumberger), and AI researchers\n Bridged geoscience and software verification domains to create a novel hybrid reasoning system\n Advanced the use of ontology-driven AI tools in operational exploration environments\n\nProject 2: OBDA Subsurface Data Integration Pilot\nRole: Portfolio Leader, SIRIUS \u2013 Centre for Scalable Data Access\n\nChallenge:\nSubsurface interpretation workflows were crippled by fragmented data silos and manual data wrangling. Geoscientists spent up to 70% of their time searching, extracting, and cleaning data \u2014 instead of interpreting it. There was no semantic layer to unify access across structured databases, unstructured reports, and diverse schemas, limiting reuse and delaying critical exploration decisions.\n\nSolution:\nLed the design and execution of a next-generation Ontology-Based Data Access (OBDA) pilot tailored to geoscience needs. Building on learnings from the Optique EU project, we:\n Created a reusable subsurface ontology and mapping framework for structured and semi-structured data\n Integrated public datasets like Client's Volve and NPD FactPages into a centralized OBDA testbed\n Introduced OTTR templating to automate ontology and mapping generation \u2014 cutting effort from weeks to minutes\n Piloted OBDA extensions for non-relational sources (e.g., DISKOS, OSDU, and PDFs)\n Enabled natural-language-like SPARQL querying using geological vocabulary\n\nOutcome:\nThe pilot transformed data access for geoscientists. Instead of requiring SQL expertise or manually navigating reports, users could query complex geological concepts across datasets with semantic precision. It demonstrated how OBDA could power scalable digital transformation in exploration \u2014 making workflows faster, smarter, and more intuitive.\nCapabilities Demonstrated:\n Leadership in semantic technologies and domain-driven ontology design\n Integration of federated OBDA across relational, non-relational, and unstructured sources\n Advanced templating and automation for agile data onboarding\n Knowledge graph engineering and digital workflow design for geoscience\n Successful transfer of EU research outcomes to industry-grade pilots\n\nProject 3: SIRIUS Subsurface Lab\nRole: Portfolio Leader, SIRIUS \u2013 Centre for Scalable Data Access\n\nChallenge:\nThe Volve field dataset, released for open research by Client, included 40,000+ files (~5TB) spanning seismic, well logs, and reservoir data. While rich, the dataset was hard to use at scale. Proprietary formats, inconsistent metadata, and the lack of an integrated query layer made it inaccessible for researchers, especially those exploring AI or semantic technologies.\n\nSolution:\nI led the design and build-out of the SIRIUS Subsurface Lab \u2014 a testbed to enable structured, semantic access to complex geoscientific data. Key contributions included:\n Re-architected the dataset into a simplified MySQL schema aligned with domain file structures\n Built a clean API for fast programmatic access and rapid tool development\n Transformed structured content into an RDF knowledge graph using custom ontology and R2RML mappings\n Deployed a SPARQL endpoint and reasoning engine for semantic exploration\n Enabled integration with external datasets and workflows, forming the foundation for OBDA and AI research\n\nOutcome:\nThe Subsurface Lab became the backbone for applied AI and ontology-driven geoscience experimentation. It reduced onboarding time for researchers, enabled reproducible benchmarking, and supported multiple pilots (e.g., OBDA, GeMS) across academia and industry. It bridged raw data and semantic reasoning \u2014 unlocking next-generation digital workflows in subsurface interpretation.\nCapabilities Demonstrated:\n End-to-end data architecture for complex, multi-format datasets\n Ontology design and R2RML mapping for knowledge graph generation\n Semantic enablement of real-world geoscience data (SPARQL, OWL, RDF)\n Cross-domain integration across well, seismic, and public data sources\n Strategic leadership in bridging academic research and industry application\n\nProject 4: Knowledge-Guided Machine Learning for Geoscience\nRole: Collaborator & Research Partner \u2014 SIRIUS Centre for Scalable Data Access\n\nChallenge:\nMachine learning in geoscience is hampered by sparse, uncertain data and a heavy reliance on categorical features that carry deep domain meaning (e.g., lithology, depositional environment). Standard ML approaches often fail in these contexts because they treat these categories as flat, statistically neutral labels \u2014 losing critical geological nuance and structure.\n\nSolution:\nAs a collaborator on this interdisciplinary research, I supported the design and validation of methods to infuse domain knowledge directly into ML pipelines through:\n Semantic similarity measures using taxonomies and poly-hierarchies to express domain-informed relationships\n Ontology-driven embeddings that replaced shallow encodings with knowledge-grounded vector representations\n Application of these methods to real-world tasks like reservoir analogue identification and clinical outcome prediction across low-resource domains\n\nOutcome:\n Demonstrated superior performance of hierarchy-based similarity vs. classical encodings in subsurface and biomedical applications\n Co-developed a new poly-hierarchy similarity measure with robust behavior under sparse labeling\n Helped validate semantic embeddings that improved generalization in tasks with limited labeled data\n Supported the foundation for future hybrid AI systems that combine structured expert knowledge with machine learning\n\nImpact:\nThe work advanced a new class of knowledge-infused ML approaches tailored for complex, data-scarce domains. It enabled more human-aligned AI systems in exploration workflows \u2014 particularly valuable in early-stage evaluation where labeled data is minimal but expert knowledge is rich.\n\nSkills & Competencies Contributed/Gained:\n Semantic encoding of categorical variables\n Ontology design and poly-hierarchy modeling\n Integration of structured domain knowledge in ML workflows\n Cross-domain application testing (geoscience, healthcare, NLP)\n Research collaboration across academia and industry\n\nProject 4: NLP Adaptation for Technical Domains with Sparse Labels\nRole: Collaborator & Geoscience Domain Expert \u2014 PhD Project on Low-Resource NLP\n\nChallenge:\nMost high-performing NLP systems require large, well-annotated datasets. In technical fields like oil & gas, such datasets are rare. Textual data is unstructured, specialized, and often proprietary \u2014 spanning well reports, log summaries, and scientific documentation. Off-the-shelf NLP models struggle to generalize in these domain-specific, low-resource settings.\n\nSolution:\nAs a domain expert, I collaborated on adapting neural NLP architectures for geoscience use cases by:\n Training domain-specific word embeddings from oil & gas corpora\n Leveraging distant supervision via geoscience knowledge bases to auto-label data\n Using dependency parsing to enhance syntactic extraction in noisy text\n Applying reinforcement learning to filter weakly labeled data\n Exploring meta-learning to generalize models across technical genres and document types\nThese techniques reframed \"low-resource\" not just in linguistic terms but as a broader challenge of working in specialized, annotation-scarce industrial domains.\n\nOutcome:\n Developed NLP pipelines capable of recognizing entities and relations (e.g., formations, reservoir properties) in geoscience texts with minimal supervision\n Proved the value of hybrid strategies combining weak supervision and domain knowledge in NER and classification tasks\n Enabled early-stage prototypes of geoscience-specific NLP tools for semantic search, auto-tagging, and knowledge extraction\n\nImpact:\nThis project paved the way for scalable language understanding in exploration workflows \u2014 even in the absence of traditional labeled corpora. It demonstrated that by infusing domain knowledge into model design and training, NLP systems can operate effectively in expert-driven, low-annotation environments.\nSkills & Competencies Contributed/Gained:\n Transfer learning and meta-learning for domain adaptation\n Weak supervision and distant labeling with domain-specific knowledge bases\n Ontology-driven language modeling for technical text\n Bridging structured geological semantics with deep learning architectures\n\nProject 5: Ontology-Driven Geological Image Annotation\nRole: Contributor \u2013 AI & Geoscience (SIRIUS Innovation Project)\n\nChallenge:\nIn subsurface exploration, geological images (e.g., cross-sections, sketch interpretations) are vital for reasoning, analogue selection, and teaching. Yet they are buried in documents with no structured metadata, making them:\n Invisible to search engines\n Inaccessible to AI/ML pipelines\n Dependent on manual interpretation by experts\n Unusable in automated workflows despite their scientific value\n\nSolution:\nAs a contributor to both the AI and geoscience dimensions of the project, I helped design and deliver SIRIUS Geo-Annotator \u2014 a prototype system that enables semantic annotation and search of geological images using ontologies and knowledge graphs.\nKey components included:\n A custom ontology (SiriusGeoOnto) to represent geological concepts in imagery\n An interactive tagging interface using navigation graphs and auto-suggestions\n OWL 2 reasoning (HermiT) and RDFox to infer spatial and conceptual relationships\n A backend that supported SPARQL querying over geological concepts and relationships\n\nOutcome:\n Enabled geoscientists to retrieve images based on geological features (e.g., \u201cfaulted carbonate reef with overlying shale\u201d) rather than file names or captions\n Populated machine-readable knowledge graphs from visual content\n Created a reusable foundation for AI-ready datasets for tasks like geological image classification and analogue search\n\nImpact:\nThis was the first ontology-driven system to semantically annotate geological images. It demonstrated how expert interpretation can be transformed into structured knowledge that is searchable, shareable, and explainable \u2014 making visual geological content accessible for both humans and machines.\nSkills & Contributions:\n Ontology design for geoscientific image domains\n Semantic reasoning and graph-based data modeling\n Bridging expert annotation workflows with AI readiness\n Developing search systems driven by logic, not keywords\n Designing systems where AI enhances expert judgment without replacing it\n\n\nResearch Program 1: Semantic Research for Subsurface Intelligence\nRole: Active Contributor \u2013 AI, Ontology, and Geoscience Integration\n\nChallenge\nSubsurface and industrial data environments are fragmented, opaque, and heavily domain specific. Geoscientists face major friction in extracting insights due to siloed formats, lack of semantic tools, and AI systems that are blind to expert knowledge. Ontology development is slow, and federated data access is unreliable.\n\nSolution\nAs an active contributor across multiple research programs at SIRIUS, I helped design and implement scalable, ontology-driven frameworks for semantic access, reasoning, and AI integration in the energy domain.\nKey initiatives and contributions:\n Ontology Engineering\no Applied OTTR templating for modular, reusable geoscience ontologies\no Bridged visual tools like OptiqueVQS with SPARQL endpoints to empower non-experts\n Semantic Integration\no Led Virtual Knowledge Graph (VKG) pipelines using Ontop for relational subsurface data\no Experimented with Materialized Knowledge Graphs using RDFox for large-scale reasoning\no Connected geoscientific semantics with structured + unstructured data pipelines\n Applied Use Cases\no Supported projects like OBDA Pilot, Geo-Annotator, and SPARQL-powered search tools\no Enabled SPARQL access to domain concepts across legacy and cloud-based systems\n\nOutcome\n Dramatically reduced time-to-insight for geoscientists querying multi-source data\n Lowered the barrier for domain experts to contribute to ontology workflows\n Created reusable frameworks that scale to real-world E&P settings\n Enabled semantic workflows that support AI, search, and human reasoning alike\n\nCore Competencies Demonstrated:\n Ontology engineering (OTTR, OWL, SHACL)\n Semantic reasoning with HermiT and RDFox\n Federated knowledge access using VKG and MKG\n Subsurface data modeling across SQL, JSON, and RDF\n Applied AI in industrial knowledge graph construction\n\nResearch Program 2: Hybrid AI for Low-Resource Scientific Domains\nRole: Contributor \u2013 AI & Domain Knowledge Integration (SIRIUS Program)\n\nChallenge\nTraditional ML fails in domains like oil & gas where data is scarce, labels are weak, and semantics are complex. Existing AI tools ignore the vast reservoir of structured domain knowledge embedded in taxonomies, heuristics, and ontologies \u2014 resulting in brittle and unexplainable models.\n\nSolution\nI collaborated on the Domain-Adapted Data Science program to fuse symbolic and neural AI for more effective learning in data-poor but knowledge-rich environments.\n\nApproach included:\n Using domain ontologies to guide ML model architecture\n Creating semantic embeddings based on geoscience hierarchies\n Applying hybrid models that combine rules, reasoning, and deep learning\n Designing interpretable AI components for real-world tasks\n\nOutcome\n Improved model performance in subsurface analogue prediction, lithology classification, and domain-specific NER\n Enabled use of small expert-curated knowledge bases to bootstrap learning\n Delivered early-stage explainability and robustness in exploration ML workflows\n\nKey Skills Applied:\n Ontology-informed ML and symbolic\u2013neural fusion\n Semantic embedding techniques for categorical features\n Low-resource NLP and hybrid architectures\n Explainable AI (XAI) for technical decision-making"
