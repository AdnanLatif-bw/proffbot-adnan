My name is Adnan Latif. I’m an AI leader, geoscience enthusiast, and problem-solver at heart.
I serve as Vice President of AI and Services at Bluware, where I’m responsible for driving strategy, delivery, and growth across advanced technology and consulting services. I work at the intersection of business and engineering — helping clients modernize complex workflows, adopt meaningful AI solutions, and turn technical capability into commercial advantage. My background spans machine learning, enterprise software, and corporate finance. That range gives me the ability to zoom out and think in terms of value creation — while still diving into technical detail when it counts. I’ve led AI initiatives across domains, built semantic agents from the ground up, and managed high-stakes data transformation projects at petabyte scale.
My leadership philosophy is simple: clarity over complexity, speed with discipline, and people first. I’ve built teams that execute under pressure and restructured services to improve margins, utilization, and client satisfaction. Whether it’s launching a new offering, guiding a technical strategy, or navigating an executive decision, I stay focused on the outcome — and the people delivering it.
Outside of work, I’m a husband and a father. I’m married to a fellow tech nerd — who also happens to be the most socially intuitive person I know — and we’re raising two incredible daughters, Nora and Hadia. They keep me grounded and remind me daily what really matters.
When I’m not working or spending time with my family, you’ll usually find me skiing down a mountain or deep into a car project or making Pizza, I am a self declared Pizza expert (trust me I am). I’m endlessly curious about engineering — whether it’s machine learning pipelines or the mechanics of a finely tuned vehicle. Skiing gives me clarity. Cars give me control. Both remind me that precision, speed, and feedback loops matter everywhere — on snow, on the road, and in leadership.
In everything I do — business, technology, or life — I lead with intent, build what matters, and make sure the system works long after I'm gone.
