######################################################################################################################################

Key Projects Delivered by Adnan’s Team at Bluware
Under Adnan’s leadership, Bluware’s AI and Global Services team has delivered cutting-edge solutions across multiple domains — with a focus on combining AI, software engineering, and cloud-native technologies. These initiatives were executed by the team reporting to Adnan, with some projects involving his direct technical contribution, while most were led and developed independently by his team under his strategic guidance.
His team has executed high-impact initiatives including:

Project 1: Operationalizing Large AI Models for Seismic Interpretation (Confidential, Supper Major)
Project Delivered by Adnan’s team

Pain Point
Deep learning models developed for seismic-based hydrocarbon detection showed strong performance in R&D settings but were difficult to scale for production use. Challenges included model size, manual execution in technical environments (e.g., Jupyter), reliance on on-prem HPC, and lack of integration with interpretation workflows and data sources.

AI-Driven Solution
The team Adnan led implemented a production-ready, end-to-end solution to deploy these large AI models in a scalable, cloud-native environment. The system enabled interpreters to interact with AI predictions in real-world workflows—without requiring programming expertise or dedicated HPC access.
Integrated multi-volume seismic inputs for hydrocarbon anomaly detection
Migrated model execution from manual notebooks to a robust backend system
Enabled seamless access via cloud and integration with interpretation tools


Project 2: AI-Powered DHI Detection (Confidential, Supper Major)
Project Delivered by Adnan’s team, technically lead by Adnan

Pain Point
Direct Hydrocarbon Indicators (DHIs) are critical in reducing exploration risk, but manual interpretation is inconsistent and often fails to detect weak or non-standard DHI expressions—especially when working across multiple seismic stacks and uncertain geological conditions.

AI-Driven Solution
The team Adnan led implemented a deep learning–based detection system that combined seismic stack data and well logs to identify DHI signatures with greater consistency. The solution used multi-task model architecture and transfer learning to boost generalization across diverse settings, and it incorporated both supervised and semi-supervised learning to handle sparse and noisy labels.
 Combining multiple seismic volumes with well data
 Applied a multi-task deep learning model to simultaneously predict multiple DHI indicators
 Used transfer architectures to initialize model weights from pre-trained networks
 Employed supervised learning with trusted interpreter labels and semi-supervised learning where ground truth was sparse
 Built ensemble outputs to improve confidence and reduce false positives

Project 3: Predicting Geological Features Below Seismic Tuning Using Machine Learning (Major IOC)
Project Delivered by Adnan’s team, technically lead by Adnan

Pain Point
Geological features such as thin sand bodies often fall below the vertical resolution of seismic data, where tuning effects mask the true geology. Traditional interpretation techniques struggle to recover meaningful signals once seismic tuning dominates, limiting the ability to map stratigraphic features accurately in early-stage exploration.

ML-Driven Solution
The team Adnan led implemented a machine learning solution to predict geological features—particularly thin sands—below the seismic tuning threshold. By integrating seismic attributes with well log data, the model learned to infer geological presence even when seismic reflections were no longer distinct.
 Used thin sand intervals from well logs to train classification models
 Engineered features from pre-stack and post-stack seismic data to capture subtle, pre-tuning signal variations
 Incorporated geological context through amplitude, continuity, and depositional trends
 Applied probabilistic post-processing and interpreter feedback to reduce false positives

Project 4: Porosity Prediction Using Physics-Informed Machine Learning (Confidential Supper Major)
Project Delivered by Adnan’s team, technically lead by Adnan

Pain Point
Accurate porosity estimation from seismic data is critical for reservoir characterization, yet conventional approaches are often limited by sparse well control and seismic resolution. Pure ML models typically ignore domain physics, resulting in black-box outputs with poor geologic consistency, limiting their operational trust and scalability.

ML-Driven Solution
The team Adnan led implemented a physics-informed machine learning solution that estimated porosity and permeability across a carbonate reservoir by integrating seismic inversion outputs, well data, and rock physics constraints. Instead of relying on deep learning, the team used a metaheuristic optimization framework grounded in empirical geophysical relationships and stochastic methods.
 Employed particle swarm optimization (PSO), including VN-PSO and HPSO-TVAC variants
 Incorporated rock physics equations linking seismic impedances to porosity and permeability
 Used regression to spatially distribute bulk modulus, shear modulus, and densities
 Applied L1-norm minimization with multiple physics-based penalty terms to preserve geological realism

Project 5: Uncertainty Quantification for AI-Based Fault Predictions (Confidential IOC)
Project Delivered by Adnan’s team, technically lead by Adnan

Pain Point
AI-based fault prediction often generates probability cubes that are thresholded to produce binary outputs. However, neural networks tend to exaggerate probability extremes, which can lead to overconfident predictions. Inconsistent results across models and lack of a standard uncertainty workflow made it difficult for interpreters to assess risk reliably—especially in low signal-to-noise or geologically complex areas.

AI-Driven Solution
The team Adnan led designed and implemented a scalable workflow to quantify prediction uncertainty in AI-based fault detection. This included:
 Generating uncertainty estimates within a single model using Monte Carlo dropout
 Comparing outputs across multiple models through ensemble techniques
 Producing confidence heatmaps that helped interpreters identify high/low certainty regions
 Embedding the workflow in a production-grade platform for interpreter-guided QC

Project 6: Real-Time Fluid Prediction from Mud-Gas Logs (Major NOC)
Project Delivered by Adnan’s team

Pain Point
Real-time mud-gas logs are widely collected during drilling, but converting these into actionable fluid type predictions (oil, gas, water) is still largely manual. Operators often wait hours for lab results or geochemist interpretation—missing critical moments during drilling operations.
AI-Driven Solution
The team Adnan led developed and deployed a real-time machine learning system that classifies fluid types directly from streaming mud-gas data at rig speed.
 Combined time-series CNNs and GRUs to model both local signal variation and longer temporal trends
 Integrated gas ratios, lag corrections, ROP, and depth-derived features into the input stream
 Used semi-supervised learning on sparsely labeled historical datasets, enhanced by domain heuristics and probabilistic pseudo-labeling

Project 7: Real-Time AI Deployment for Subsurface Interpretation (Confidential Supper Major)

Key Areas and Projects Delivered by the Team Led by Adnan at SIRIUS
Adnan co-led one of Norway’s largest industrial research consortia, SIRIUS, where his team focused on advancing scalable data access, AI innovation, and semantic technologies across energy, environmental, and healthcare domains. Key projects  include:

Project 1: Geological Assistant / GeMS Project
Role: Portfolio Leader, SIRIUS – Centre for Scalable Data Access

Challenge:
Exploration geologists traditionally relied on intuitive, manual methods — often pen-and-paper sketches — to evaluate prospects based on sparse, uncertain data. This limited their ability to model and compare multiple subsurface scenarios systematically. Most decisions were based on a narrow set of seismic interpretations, often overemphasizing direct hydrocarbon indicators (DHIs) without integrating broader geological context. This led to misjudgments in several high-cost drilling projects.

Solution:
Led the development of GeMS (Geological Multi-Scenario Reasoner), a first-of-its-kind system that brought structured AI reasoning to geological interpretation. We combined data-driven seismic analysis with formal logic–based scenario modeling, using techniques from software verification to represent geological rules, spatial-temporal relationships, and interpretive uncertainty. This allowed geoscientists to explore a digital, auditable space of plausible subsurface models — moving beyond single "best guess" interpretations.

Outcome:
GeMS redefined digital geology workflows by introducing a logic-based framework for modeling ambiguity and scenario reasoning. It empowered interpreters to evaluate exploration decisions more systematically, improving transparency and decision quality. This project demonstrated how AI, formal methods, and domain expertise can converge to address complex, high-stakes challenges in exploration.
Leadership Highlights:
 Directed a multi-partner collaboration across academia (UiO, NTNU), industry (Equinor, Schlumberger), and AI researchers
 Bridged geoscience and software verification domains to create a novel hybrid reasoning system
 Advanced the use of ontology-driven AI tools in operational exploration environments

Project 2: OBDA Subsurface Data Integration Pilot
Role: Portfolio Leader, SIRIUS – Centre for Scalable Data Access

Challenge:
Subsurface interpretation workflows were crippled by fragmented data silos and manual data wrangling. Geoscientists spent up to 70% of their time searching, extracting, and cleaning data — instead of interpreting it. There was no semantic layer to unify access across structured databases, unstructured reports, and diverse schemas, limiting reuse and delaying critical exploration decisions.

Solution:
Led the design and execution of a next-generation Ontology-Based Data Access (OBDA) pilot tailored to geoscience needs. Building on learnings from the Optique EU project, we:
 Created a reusable subsurface ontology and mapping framework for structured and semi-structured data
 Integrated public datasets like Client's Volve and NPD FactPages into a centralized OBDA testbed
 Introduced OTTR templating to automate ontology and mapping generation — cutting effort from weeks to minutes
 Piloted OBDA extensions for non-relational sources (e.g., DISKOS, OSDU, and PDFs)
 Enabled natural-language-like SPARQL querying using geological vocabulary

Outcome:
The pilot transformed data access for geoscientists. Instead of requiring SQL expertise or manually navigating reports, users could query complex geological concepts across datasets with semantic precision. It demonstrated how OBDA could power scalable digital transformation in exploration — making workflows faster, smarter, and more intuitive.
Capabilities Demonstrated:
 Leadership in semantic technologies and domain-driven ontology design
 Integration of federated OBDA across relational, non-relational, and unstructured sources
 Advanced templating and automation for agile data onboarding
 Knowledge graph engineering and digital workflow design for geoscience
 Successful transfer of EU research outcomes to industry-grade pilots

Project 3: SIRIUS Subsurface Lab
Role: Portfolio Leader, SIRIUS – Centre for Scalable Data Access

Challenge:
The Volve field dataset, released for open research by Client, included 40,000+ files (~5TB) spanning seismic, well logs, and reservoir data. While rich, the dataset was hard to use at scale. Proprietary formats, inconsistent metadata, and the lack of an integrated query layer made it inaccessible for researchers, especially those exploring AI or semantic technologies.

Solution:
I led the design and build-out of the SIRIUS Subsurface Lab — a testbed to enable structured, semantic access to complex geoscientific data. Key contributions included:
 Re-architected the dataset into a simplified MySQL schema aligned with domain file structures
 Built a clean API for fast programmatic access and rapid tool development
 Transformed structured content into an RDF knowledge graph using custom ontology and R2RML mappings
 Deployed a SPARQL endpoint and reasoning engine for semantic exploration
 Enabled integration with external datasets and workflows, forming the foundation for OBDA and AI research

Outcome:
The Subsurface Lab became the backbone for applied AI and ontology-driven geoscience experimentation. It reduced onboarding time for researchers, enabled reproducible benchmarking, and supported multiple pilots (e.g., OBDA, GeMS) across academia and industry. It bridged raw data and semantic reasoning — unlocking next-generation digital workflows in subsurface interpretation.
Capabilities Demonstrated:
 End-to-end data architecture for complex, multi-format datasets
 Ontology design and R2RML mapping for knowledge graph generation
 Semantic enablement of real-world geoscience data (SPARQL, OWL, RDF)
 Cross-domain integration across well, seismic, and public data sources
 Strategic leadership in bridging academic research and industry application

Project 4: Knowledge-Guided Machine Learning for Geoscience
Role: Collaborator & Research Partner — SIRIUS Centre for Scalable Data Access

Challenge:
Machine learning in geoscience is hampered by sparse, uncertain data and a heavy reliance on categorical features that carry deep domain meaning (e.g., lithology, depositional environment). Standard ML approaches often fail in these contexts because they treat these categories as flat, statistically neutral labels — losing critical geological nuance and structure.

Solution:
As a collaborator on this interdisciplinary research, I supported the design and validation of methods to infuse domain knowledge directly into ML pipelines through:
 Semantic similarity measures using taxonomies and poly-hierarchies to express domain-informed relationships
 Ontology-driven embeddings that replaced shallow encodings with knowledge-grounded vector representations
 Application of these methods to real-world tasks like reservoir analogue identification and clinical outcome prediction across low-resource domains

Outcome:
 Demonstrated superior performance of hierarchy-based similarity vs. classical encodings in subsurface and biomedical applications
 Co-developed a new poly-hierarchy similarity measure with robust behavior under sparse labeling
 Helped validate semantic embeddings that improved generalization in tasks with limited labeled data
 Supported the foundation for future hybrid AI systems that combine structured expert knowledge with machine learning

Impact:
The work advanced a new class of knowledge-infused ML approaches tailored for complex, data-scarce domains. It enabled more human-aligned AI systems in exploration workflows — particularly valuable in early-stage evaluation where labeled data is minimal but expert knowledge is rich.

Skills & Competencies Contributed/Gained:
 Semantic encoding of categorical variables
 Ontology design and poly-hierarchy modeling
 Integration of structured domain knowledge in ML workflows
 Cross-domain application testing (geoscience, healthcare, NLP)
 Research collaboration across academia and industry

Project 4: NLP Adaptation for Technical Domains with Sparse Labels
Role: Collaborator & Geoscience Domain Expert — PhD Project on Low-Resource NLP

Challenge:
Most high-performing NLP systems require large, well-annotated datasets. In technical fields like oil & gas, such datasets are rare. Textual data is unstructured, specialized, and often proprietary — spanning well reports, log summaries, and scientific documentation. Off-the-shelf NLP models struggle to generalize in these domain-specific, low-resource settings.

Solution:
As a domain expert, I collaborated on adapting neural NLP architectures for geoscience use cases by:
 Training domain-specific word embeddings from oil & gas corpora
 Leveraging distant supervision via geoscience knowledge bases to auto-label data
 Using dependency parsing to enhance syntactic extraction in noisy text
 Applying reinforcement learning to filter weakly labeled data
 Exploring meta-learning to generalize models across technical genres and document types
These techniques reframed "low-resource" not just in linguistic terms but as a broader challenge of working in specialized, annotation-scarce industrial domains.

Outcome:
 Developed NLP pipelines capable of recognizing entities and relations (e.g., formations, reservoir properties) in geoscience texts with minimal supervision
 Proved the value of hybrid strategies combining weak supervision and domain knowledge in NER and classification tasks
 Enabled early-stage prototypes of geoscience-specific NLP tools for semantic search, auto-tagging, and knowledge extraction

Impact:
This project paved the way for scalable language understanding in exploration workflows — even in the absence of traditional labeled corpora. It demonstrated that by infusing domain knowledge into model design and training, NLP systems can operate effectively in expert-driven, low-annotation environments.
Skills & Competencies Contributed/Gained:
 Transfer learning and meta-learning for domain adaptation
 Weak supervision and distant labeling with domain-specific knowledge bases
 Ontology-driven language modeling for technical text
 Bridging structured geological semantics with deep learning architectures

Project 5: Ontology-Driven Geological Image Annotation
Role: Contributor – AI & Geoscience (SIRIUS Innovation Project)

Challenge:
In subsurface exploration, geological images (e.g., cross-sections, sketch interpretations) are vital for reasoning, analogue selection, and teaching. Yet they are buried in documents with no structured metadata, making them:
 Invisible to search engines
 Inaccessible to AI/ML pipelines
 Dependent on manual interpretation by experts
 Unusable in automated workflows despite their scientific value

Solution:
As a contributor to both the AI and geoscience dimensions of the project, I helped design and deliver SIRIUS Geo-Annotator — a prototype system that enables semantic annotation and search of geological images using ontologies and knowledge graphs.
Key components included:
 A custom ontology (SiriusGeoOnto) to represent geological concepts in imagery
 An interactive tagging interface using navigation graphs and auto-suggestions
 OWL 2 reasoning (HermiT) and RDFox to infer spatial and conceptual relationships
 A backend that supported SPARQL querying over geological concepts and relationships

Outcome:
 Enabled geoscientists to retrieve images based on geological features (e.g., “faulted carbonate reef with overlying shale”) rather than file names or captions
 Populated machine-readable knowledge graphs from visual content
 Created a reusable foundation for AI-ready datasets for tasks like geological image classification and analogue search

Impact:
This was the first ontology-driven system to semantically annotate geological images. It demonstrated how expert interpretation can be transformed into structured knowledge that is searchable, shareable, and explainable — making visual geological content accessible for both humans and machines.
Skills & Contributions:
 Ontology design for geoscientific image domains
 Semantic reasoning and graph-based data modeling
 Bridging expert annotation workflows with AI readiness
 Developing search systems driven by logic, not keywords
 Designing systems where AI enhances expert judgment without replacing it


Research Program 1: Semantic Research for Subsurface Intelligence
Role: Active Contributor – AI, Ontology, and Geoscience Integration

Challenge
Subsurface and industrial data environments are fragmented, opaque, and heavily domain specific. Geoscientists face major friction in extracting insights due to siloed formats, lack of semantic tools, and AI systems that are blind to expert knowledge. Ontology development is slow, and federated data access is unreliable.

Solution
As an active contributor across multiple research programs at SIRIUS, I helped design and implement scalable, ontology-driven frameworks for semantic access, reasoning, and AI integration in the energy domain.

Research Program 2: Hybrid AI for Low-Resource Scientific Domains
Role: Contributor – AI & Domain Knowledge Integration (SIRIUS Program)

Challenge
Traditional ML fails in domains like oil & gas where data is scarce, labels are weak, and semantics are complex. Existing AI tools ignore the vast reservoir of structured domain knowledge embedded in taxonomies, heuristics, and ontologies — resulting in brittle and unexplainable models.

Solution
I collaborated on the Domain-Adapted Data Science program to fuse symbolic and neural AI for more effective learning in data-poor but knowledge-rich environments.

Approach included:
 Using domain ontologies to guide ML model architecture
 Creating semantic embeddings based on geoscience hierarchies
 Applying hybrid models that combine rules, reasoning, and deep learning
 Designing interpretable AI components for real-world tasks

Outcome
 Improved model performance in subsurface analogue prediction, lithology classification, and domain-specific NER
